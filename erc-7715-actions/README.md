# ðŸ¦Š MetaMask DTK Track: Best Use of ERC-7715 Actions

## Problem
How can we unlock advanced features like token streaming, delegated permissions, or subscriptions using the new ERC-7715 Actions feature?

## Solution Idea
Build a **Web3 Subscription Platform** where creators can grant limited-time access to content using token streams via DTK.

- Stream-based access control
- Delegated content access for teams or DAOs
- Works with MetaMask Snap or DTK SDK

## Tools / Stack
- MetaMask DTK (ERC-7715 Actions)
- Replit (no local install)
- Scaffolded via Thirdweb/Fleek if needed

## To Do
- [ ] Define smart contract use cases
- [ ] Simulate interactions with DTK
- [ ] UI mock or working prototype
- [ ] Finalize submission docs
