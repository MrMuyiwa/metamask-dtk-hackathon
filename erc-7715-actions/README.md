# ü™¶ LegacyChain ‚Äì Time-Released Memory Vault

> A MetaMask DTK Hackathon Project (ERC-7715 Actions Track)

## Problem

People want to leave digital assets, messages, and tokens to their loved ones ‚Äî but there's no trustless, decentralized way to do it securely and with timing controls.

## Solution

LegacyChain is a decentralized, time-locked memory vault powered by MetaMask‚Äôs Delegation Toolkit (ERC-7715 Actions). It allows users to:

- Stream unlock permissions to loved ones
- Set future conditions (e.g. after 1 year of inactivity)
- Delegate guardians to manage retrieval
- Leave messages, NFTs, or token gifts for the future

## Tools / Stack

- MetaMask Delegation Toolkit (ERC-7715 Actions)
- Replit (React frontend, DTK integration)
- NFT.Storage or IPFS (for storing messages/images)
- Optional: Gaia Agent for smart guardianship logic

## Features

- Vault Creation: Write messages, upload files, attach NFTs
- Time Logic: Release on a specific date or upon inactivity
- Delegation: Grant access to loved ones with limited rights
- Auto-Revocation: Streamed access stops after time expires

## To Do

- [ ] Create UI screens (mockups or Replit)
- [ ] Simulate DTK delegation actions (write pseudocode or logic flow)
- [ ] Describe lifecycle of a vault (create ‚ûù delegate ‚ûù unlock)
- [ ] Finalize README for submission
- [ ] Record walkthrough or Loom demo
